# Flashcard React App

This project was bourne out of a simple idea - I wanted to practise my React skills whilst on a flight. I asked ChatGPT for a prompt that should take me about an hour (as I was flying from London to Newquay), and it give me a rough prompt for a flashcard app. 

This is what I managed to achieve in flight, with no internet access.
